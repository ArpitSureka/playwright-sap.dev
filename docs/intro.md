# Intro

Aim of this project was because to allow easy testing and automation of SAP Websites. automating sap websites was very difficult with playwright because the codegen feature of playwright gave incorrect locators because of which it was very timeconsuming. moreover a lot of html properties keep on changing in sap websites as deployment changes. this npm repository is an extension on playwright with improved locators and codegen to work with sap websites 

works with these sap websites 
- SAP Fiori Launchpad
- SAP WebGUI
