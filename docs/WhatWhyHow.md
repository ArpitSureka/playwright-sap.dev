# What, Why and How

### What

Playwright SAP is a node module built on top of playwright to ease the process of automating and testing SAP Websites.

### Why

Using playwright to automate SAP Websites is not easy as locators that come from using playwright codegen are a lot of times not readable and they keep on changing and are not stable.

### How

Playwright SAP provides new locators for SAP websites and new methods. 

SAP Applications are primarily of 2 types: 

1. SAP Web GUI
2. SAP Fiori

Playwright SAP provides new locators for both types of SAP applications.
